Welcome to the Sowers Camping Emporium automated shop terminal!
This fantastic Java based program offers cutting edge stock management and the ability to purchase straight from the terminal!

Ensure any terminal with this program loaded has JDK 8 or later, compile with javac *.java, and run the program with java Runner!

This program uses a reserved file for sold out and available stocks each.
These are then loaded into an Array List to display in the active program.
From here you may purchase, order a restock, and report products out of stock.
And when you are done it permanently commits the change in stock to the aforementioned reserved files!
